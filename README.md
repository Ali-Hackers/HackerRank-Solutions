Sure, here is a detailed README file for your GitHub repository that describes the `count` function:

# Count Between Two Sets

## Description

This repository contains a JavaScript function `count` that determines the number of integers between two sets of numbers. Specifically, it calculates how many integers are multiples of all elements in the first set and are also divisors of all elements in the second set.

## How It Works

Given two arrays `a` and `b`:
1. The function calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of all elements in array `a`.
2. It then calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of all elements in array `b`.
3. Finally, it counts the number of multiples of the LCM that are also divisors of the GCD.

## Usage

### Function Signature

```javascript
function count(a, b)
```

### Parameters

- `a`: An array of integers representing the first set of numbers.
- `b`: An array of integers representing the second set of numbers.

### Returns

- An integer representing the count of numbers that are multiples of all elements in `a` and divisors of all elements in `b`.

## Example

### Code Example

```javascript
function count(a, b) {
    let count = 0;
    let bignumber = 0;     
    let lcmA = a[0];
    for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
        lcmA = lcm(lcmA, a[i]);
    }

    bignumber = b[0];
    for (let i = 1; i < b.length; i++) {
        bignumber = gcd(bignumber, b[i]);
    }

    function lcm(a, b) {
        return (a * b) / gcd(a, b);
    }
    
    function gcd(a, b) {
        while (b !== 0) {
            let temp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }

    for (let i = lcmA; i <= bignumber; i += lcmA) {
        if (bignumber % i === 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}

// Example usage
let a = [2, 4];
let b = [16, 32, 96];
console.log(count(a, b)); // Output: 3
```

### Explanation

In this example:
- The LCM of the array `a` is 4.
- The GCD of the array `b` is 16.
- The numbers between the two sets are 4, 8, and 16, resulting in a count of 3.

## Getting Started

To use this function:
1. Copy the provided code.
2. Test it with different sets of arrays `a` and `b` to see how many integers fit the criteria.
