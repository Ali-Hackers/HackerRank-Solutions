# Count Between Two Sets

## Description

This project provides a function `count` that determines how many integers exist between two sets of numbers. Specifically, it calculates the number of integers that are multiples of all elements in the first set and are also divisors of all elements in the second set.

## How It Works

Given two arrays `a` and `b`:
- The function first calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of all elements in the array `a`.
- It then calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of all elements in the array `b`.
- Finally, it counts the number of multiples of the LCM that are also divisors of the GCD.

## Usage

### Function Signature

```javascript
function count(a, b)
```

### Parameters

- `a`: An array of integers representing the first set of numbers.
- `b`: An array of integers representing the second set of numbers.

### Returns

- An integer representing the count of numbers that are multiples of all elements in `a` and divisors of all elements in `b`.

## Example

### Code Example

```javascript
function count(a, b) {
    let count = 0;
    let bignumber = 0;     
    let lcmA = a[0];
    for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
        lcmA = lcm(lcmA, a[i]);
    }

    bignumber = b[0];
    for (let i = 1; i < b.length; i++) {
        bignumber = gcd(bignumber, b[i]);
    }

    function lcm(a, b) {
        return (a * b) / gcd(a, b);
    }
    
    function gcd(a, b) {
        while (b !== 0) {
            let temp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }

    for (let i = lcmA; i <= bignumber; i += lcmA) {
        if (bignumber % i === 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}

// Example usage
let a = [2, 4];
let b = [16, 32, 96];
console.log(count(a, b)); // Output: 3
```

### Explanation

In this example:
- The LCM of the array `a` is 4.
- The GCD of the array `b` is 16.
- The numbers between the two sets are 4, 8, and 16.

## Getting Started

To get started with using the function, you can copy the provided code and test it with different sets of arrays `a` and `b`.
